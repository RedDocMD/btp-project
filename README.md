# Automated Knowledge Transfer Framework for Python

This repo links to the code I have written for my BTP project:

- [**Pyhole**](https://github.com/RedDocMD/pyhole) - Contains the Python code for detecting keyword arguments, integrating with Sphinx and with Pytest.
- [**parse-py**](https://github.com/RedDocMD/parse-py) - Indexer for Python repositories, written in Rust and exposing a Python interface using PyO3.
